# Beginners Guide to Texas Hold'em Strategy

## Starting Hands

For a 6-max game, a solid tight agressive (TAG) player will most likely have a VPIP/PFR stat of 19/17 - 22/20.
This means that we should be playing about 20% of our hands and that we should be raising with the majority of those hands.

The advice for this range of hands assumes that
 * We are not short stacked (more than 40bb)
 * An opening raise is around 3bb to 6bb

### Premium Hands
 * AA, KK
   - raise/re-raise from any position
   - call any shove

 * AKs, QQ, JJ
   - raise/re-raise from any position
   - lean towards call for shoves

 * AKo, AQs, AQo, KQs, TT
   - raise or call a raise from any position
   - lean towards fold for shoves

### Playable Hands
 * _Broadway Hands_: AQs, AQo, AJs, AJo, ATs, ATo, KQs, KQo, KJs, KJo, KTs, QJs, QJo, QTs, QTo, JTs, JTo
   - raise from any position for the higher end of this range
   - raise from mid to late position for the lower end of this range
   - consider pot odds and opponents' ranges for a fold/re-raise if raised before you

 * _Medium Pairs_: 99, 88, 77
   - raise in mid to late position
   - call if raised before you
   - fold if there are re-raises

 * _Suited Connectors_: T9s, 98s, 87s, 76s
   - raise if limped/folded to you in mid to late position
   - re-raise half the time in mid to late position
   - call in cheap multi-way pots

### Marginal Hands
 * _A-x Suited_: A9s, A8s, A7s, A6s, A5s, A4s, A3s, A2s
   - raise if limped/folded to you in late position
   - fold if raised before you

 * _Low Pairs_: 66, 55, 44
   - raise in late position half the time
   - check/fold if not improved on the flop

 * _Unconnected_: Q9s, Q9o, Q8s, J9s, J9o, J8s, T8s, 97s
   - raise in mid to late position
   - fold to raises in early/mid position

 * _Suited Connectors_: 65s, 54s, 43s, 32s
   - play in cheap multi-way pots 
   - fold to a raise with no callers

## Continuation Betting

 * The term continuation betting refers to a bet made by the pre-flop raiser after seeing the flop.
 * A continuation bet can be made even if the pre-flop raiser's hand was not improved by the flop.
 * A continuation bet should vary between 2/3 and 3/4 of the pot

### Reasons for Continuation Betting

The following is a list of factors that _might_ cause you to make a continuation bet.
The presence of some of these factors does not mean that we necessarily have to c-bet
We should not be c-betting every flop without thinking about it.

 1. Value betting 
    * The flop made or improved our hand
    * Our bet size gives us favorable pot odds if we are drawing
    * We _want_ our opponent to call with a worse hand

 2. To win the pot outright
    * There are fewer players in the pot or players have been known to play tightly
    * We are in late position and it has been checked to us
    * The flop texture is favorable 
      + An opponent would only call with a pocket pair, or a weak hand (unlikely if we have raised pre-flop and our opponent has a tight pre-flop range)
      + There are no flush or straight draw possibilities on the board

### Reasons to _NOT_ Continuation Bet

 1. Playing against loose opponents with wide ranges
 2. Our hand has no hope of improving/winning
 3. We are playing against an aggressive opponent that may put us to a difficult decision if we c-bet
 4. To control the size of the pot

### Double Barrelling

Double barrelling refers to making a bet on the turn after making a continuation bet.

When deciding to double barrel, reads on other players become important, as well as understanding how our own playing style is perceived

We might double barrel when:
 * We read our opponent as a drawing hand that wasn't helped on the turn
 * The turn card is something that scares our opponent
 * We know our opponent frequently calls on the flop but won't continue without a made hand
